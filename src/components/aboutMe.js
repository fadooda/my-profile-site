                            I am a results-driven Full-Stack Engineer with over five years of experience designing and optimizing scalable, high-performance applications and distributed systems. I specialize in React.js, Node.js, SQL, Kubernetes, and DevOps, with a strong background in data analytics, reliability engineering, and cloud technologies.

I have successfully optimized SQL queries, achieving a 75% efficiency gain, and developed SQL-based reporting solutions supporting $100M+ in subscription analytics. Additionally, I have experience in DevOps, system monitoring, and security integration to enhance software reliability and performance. Currently, I am pursuing an AWS Developer Associate certification (exp. May 2025) to deepen my cloud expertise.

Key Achievements
âœ… Full-Stack Development: At AppDirect, built a React.js/Redux-based search feature, improving selection speed by 70% and achieving 100% Jest test coverage for critical components.
âœ… DevOps & Monitoring: Integrated Datadog for real-time visualization of 10K+ user interactions, enhancing system observability and troubleshooting.
âœ… SQL Optimization: At Deutsche Bank, reduced SQL query execution time from 20 minutes to 5 minutes by refactoring 5M+ row reconciliation datasets and eliminating inefficient self-joins.
âœ… Security & Authentication: Configured Kerberos authentication for LDAP integration in a distributed Cassandra cluster, ensuring secure single sign-on (SSO) access.

Core Competencies
ðŸ”¹ Programming Languages: JavaScript, SQL, Scala
ðŸ”¹ Frameworks & Tools: React.js, Node.js, Jest, Kafka
ðŸ”¹ Databases: MySQL, Sybase, MongoDB
ðŸ”¹ DevOps & Monitoring: Kubernetes, Docker, Datadog
