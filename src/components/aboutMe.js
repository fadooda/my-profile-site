                            <p>
                                I am a results-driven Full-Stack Engineer with over five years of experience designing and optimizing scalable, high-performance applications and distributed systems. I specialize in React.js, Node.js, SQL, Kubernetes, and DevOps, with a strong background in data analytics, reliability engineering, and cloud technologies.
                                I have successfully optimized SQL queries, achieving a 75% efficiency gain, and developed SQL-based reporting solutions supporting $100M+ in subscription analytics. Additionally, I have experience in DevOps, system monitoring, and security integration to enhance software reliability and performance. Currently pursuing career opportunities to deepen cloud expertise, focusing on automation, reliability, and user experience, with the aim of contributing to cloud-native, scalable systems in a Full-Stack or Cloud Engineering role.
